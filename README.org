#+TITLE: LangJamGameJam: Build a language and write a game in it

We started planning on December 2nd and settled on Haskell as the implementation language.

We will transpile our target language to JavaScript to access its larger ecosystem, such as the Kaplay game engine. This will also reduce how much of our work involves making a game engine.

* Stack
https://discourse.haskell.org/t/solved-stack-new-and-stack-init-failing-missing-aws-asset-nosuchbucket/9902

my global configuration was out of date so I added this line to ~/.stack/config.yaml

```
urls:
  latest-snapshot: https://stackage-haddock.haskell.org/snapshots.json
```

** stack new haskelloni48 new-template
** stack init
** stack run
hello world finally runs!

with Stack, we'll have an easy way to add dependencies

* Kaplay
